#Personal Settings & Dotfiles

This repository holds all of my dotfiles and custom user settings for bash, git,
Sublime Text 3, and gnupg.

## Usage
To link these dotfiles to their proper locations, run `./push_dotfiles.sh`.
  
> **NOTE:** You should back up your old dotfiles before running this script, as it
> will delete them.
